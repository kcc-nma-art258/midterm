			<p class="credits">BY: JOSHUA Y. CLEMENTS</p>
			<p class="welcome">Welcome to "Frame Yo Work", a frame work that uses Sass to create compartmentalized css files that allows developers to work efficiently while staying organized.</p>

			<h2> Yo Typography</h2>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-1"></div>
				<div class="col-5">
					<p>With an ever expanding list of typefaces that are available for web use, selecting the right typeface or type-pairing is one of the easiest ways to distinguish your webpage from the rest. Whether large or small, each webpage’s goal is to display it’s content in an organized and appealing manor—that's why choosing a typeface that reflects the mood of your content but also remains legible after being stylized is a crucial part of any design. So before you start adding in your amazing photos, videos, and color palettes, take a moment to find the right typeface, because “if I can’t read it, you’re wasting my time”.</p>
					</div>
				<div class="col-5">
					<p>Frame Yo Work uses the typeface Work Sans, a free font designed by Wei Huang for google, which comes in 9 weights ranging from 100-900 and is implemented using a link tag that google provides. The base font size for the body of the html file is set at 16px, with a line height of 1.4 and a font weight of 300. The headings of this frame work use the font family’s heavier font weights (600, 700, 800, 900) in combination with a typographic scale of 1.6 in order to clearly define each section. Pairing these these heavy font weights with a thin weight helps to add texture to the web page and also creates a hierarchy system.</p>

			<div class="row">

				<div class="col-5">
					<p>Whether you build a website from scratch or use a frame work to expedite the process, nearly all websites these days use a grid system that allow s designers to have control of their webpages design and structure.  Some of the more popular grid systems today use 12 column system as it allows designers the most flexibility with their design. But as with most things in life not all webpages are created equal, so it is important to understand how your content interacts with your grid the how your layout responds to different media sizes.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-5">
					<p>Frame Yo Work uses a 12 column grid with a total width of 100% within a  960px wide container. This allows the columns and their contents to be flexible when users resize their browser windows and also helps to ensure that elements stay within their respective areas depending on the size of the users device. Based on the size of the content any combination of columns can be set to display as inline-block as long as their total add up to 12.</p>

				<div class="col-5">
					<p>Every website you visit is trying to communicate something to its viewer, but what happens when the viewer wants to respond back? Well this why nearly all websites that you see these days have some type of form that is either used for collecting information or as a way for users to communicate with website owners. Some of the most common forms that you will see around the web are login and email forms.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-5">
					<p>Frame Yo Work does not yet use any forms within its frame work, but don’t worry because it still comes with some basic forms that are commonly used on the web already set up, and ready to go. We even include basic controls that work together with our forms to complete the fields that you set up. Each is easily customizable to fit our user’s needs and designs and thanks to Sass is easy to find in our form.css file.</p>

			<h2>Yo Buttons</h2>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-1"></div>
				<div class="col-5">
					<p>The purpose of a button is to guide a user through a website, therefore they should be easily distinguishable from other elements while not drawing to much attention to themselves. Just like an image or type, buttons can either help or hurt a website's overall design, so when in doubt just remember “less is more”.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-5">
					<p>For this frame work, two styles of buttons are used to show how both a plain and a stylized button can be implemented into any design while still respecting the over-all flow of the frame work. It is also handy to have two styles of buttons when designing a webpage in-case there are buttons that play a more important role than others.</p>

			<h2>Yo Utilities</h2>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-1"></div>
				<div class="col-5">
					<p>Thanks to Sass, developers are now able minimize the amount of lines generated when building a website, and use programs that generate compiled CSS files. One of the main reasons for this is the utilities file that is used as storage site for variables, mixins, and calculators that are used in other sections of Sass file. This ability to reference code from other locations within a  document is what makes Sass one of the most powerful scripting languages today.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-5">
					<p>Frame Yo Work uses its utilities file to generate variables that are repeated extensively through out the document minimizing the need to remember specific values when styling your document. Because the 12 column grid is such a critical part of how this document functions, a clear-fix must be applied in order to allow columns to float left, rather than stacking as block elements,  a clear float mixin is used to compress ten lines of code into just one.</p>

			<h2>Yo Media Queries</h2>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-1"></div>
				<div class="col-5">
					<p>Media queries are used in responsive web design to target specific device sizes and to make adjustments to elements that may not be rendering ideally when a browser size is changed. They can be used to target entire files or specific sections and elements. Common practice today is to have at least 3 media queries that target desktop, tablet, and mobile device sizes.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-5">
					<p>Within Frame Yo Work, there are three media sizes that target the three common device sizes. The entire document is affected by one main query that is rendered when screen sizes are smaller than 600px, while two additional queries are used to target the line length of paragraphs so that character counts stay within the recommended 45-75 character range.</p>

	@media screen and (min-width: 780px){
	width: (100% / 12) * $i;
	}
	}

	p {
	@media screen and (max-width: 779px) {
